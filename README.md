# MC_Command_IDE

###### Currently in pre-Alpha phase

- Not all parsers are done
- Buggy GUI (plans for Beta)


#### Future features
- [ ] Transfer windows API code to OpenGL for cross-platform support
- [ ] Refactor the whole code :I (2 - 5 times)
- [ ] Re-Write the Json Reader for multiaccess-one_tree (to have 1 tree and multiple branches; allows for multiple opened documents)
- [ ] Load tree resources on system start-up and access on demand (need to come up with cross-platform solution)
